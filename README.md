<h2> Simple Expense App using Ionic Framework V2.X </h2>

Hello,

I have started working on mobile app development and just started building a simple expense app using ionic cross platform framework 

I have developed a simple app that will have following functionality in Version 1.O

=> User Can add expenses he/she has done
=> Can create custom category based on his/her need
=> User can view live pocket balance.
=> user can track the transection (i called it here as source of income for example ATM,Or any ther cash  transaction )


This project have following plugins 

=> Plugin :  QR code scanner <br> 
   Use    : To  scan QR code <br>
   Url    : https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/barcode-scanner/<br>
  command to install this plugin  : ionic cordova plugin add phonegap-plugin-barcodescanner <br>
                                    npm install --save @ionic-native/barcode-scanner <br>
<p>
  => i have build one simple webapp using codeigniter that will load unique QR code on every new request <br>
  => i have seen this feature in whatsapp web so i have tried to make it by my own so i have did that <br>
  => you can upload the webapp code to your domain and you can scan that qr code from the app and you will get the same user experiance 
     that the mobile app  has same like whats app web but the diffrence is that you will only able to see the information but you dont have <br>
   rights to create any thing (new expense,categoty or transaction) as its  still in developemt i wil update the code as soon as ready to ship<br>

</p>
